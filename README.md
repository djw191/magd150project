# MAGD 150 GitHub Project

**Derek Woodard**

Here you will find many projects I have completed in my MAGD 150 class.

## Projects
### Lab 6
Lab 6 is a very simple program that explores using a class in processing,
creating a cloud that follows your mouse, and disappears when you click.

### Lab 7
Lab 7 Explores Classes further, adds rotational objects, and implements basic
gravity into a 2d Program.  When the player clicks, its shoots 10 balls at a
random angle and velocity towards a cup.  The cursor is a spinning red and
white pinwheel.
