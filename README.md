# MAGD 150 GitHub Project

**Derek Woodard**

Here you will find many projects I have completed in my MAGD 150 class.

## Projects
### Lab 6
Lab 6 is a very simple program that explores using a class in processing,
creating a cloud that follows your mouse, and disappears when you click.

### Lab 7
Lab 7 Explores Classes further, adds rotational objects, and implements basic
gravity into a 2d Program.  When the player clicks, its shoots 10 balls at a
random angle and velocity towards a cup.  The cursor is a spinning red and
white pinwheel.

### Lab 8
Lab 8 demonstrates the ability to manipulate a sketch in processing and then
save your creation to a file, such as a pdf.  I also used image loading.  A
player clicks to control the spinning of text, and then presses a key to take
a snapshot of the instant and save it to a pdf.  The theme is a demotivational
poster.
